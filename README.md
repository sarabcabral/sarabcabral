Iâ€™m a 26-year-old Computer Science graduate from UFMS and an instructor at a professional training school.
Currently, Iâ€™m studying Advertising and Propaganda at Uniasselvi and enrolled in a postgraduate course in Algorithms and Programming Logic.

Iâ€™m passionate about games, books, software development, management, graphic design, and marketing.
Iâ€™m always in search of knowledge and new experiences to grow in tech and beyond.

Letâ€™s build something awesome together!
